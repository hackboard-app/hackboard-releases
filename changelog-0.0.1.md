# Changelog for Hackboard v0.0.1

## What's New
- Super combos (key combinations with multiple letters) can now be recoreded like normal key combinations under 'From'. 
- Both super combos (under 'From') and normal key combinations (under 'To') can be recorded without existing keymaps affecting the recording process.
